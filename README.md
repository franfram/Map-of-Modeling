# Map-of-Modeling
An attempt on making a map of the modeling world


inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA

Empirical models, Explanatory models

Bayesian Statistics
Frequentist Statistics

Supervised Unsupervised Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning

No causes in, no causes out // No causes in, nothing out --> Causal modeling

ABC

Symbolic regression

Linear models
Non-linear models

DiffEq models

Models as information compression

Models as representations

Speaking math?

Approximation problems

Observation is imperfect --> Observation models

Causal models vs Statistical models

Computation in models

Algorithms used in modeling: MCMC, 

Write with bookdown? with nvdev?
